# Cryptracker

Well, I started to play around with chart.js in react using next.js instead of create-react-app. I came across the coingecko API and challenged myself to implement them both. I had a few issues naturally and there are some additional features I would have liked to add such as a search that would return the desired crypto and its weekly or monthly stats.

Overall I feel like I have a better understanding of how to use a charting library and also the useEffect hook for Get requests so the project was a success. The project did not take long, but I had a few of those moments where I would suddenly wake up at 4 am trying to find solutions to the problems I was facing in development. So I will say I really enjoyed it.
